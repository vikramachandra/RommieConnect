# RoomieConnect
RoomieConnect is a website that gives users a chance to find roommates for an apartment, or any other type of housing. The website will have users fill out their interests and then view potential candidates based on their results. It gives people a chance to meet the right people before they move into their new home. If a person on the website sees a candidate that they would potentially room with, they can select that candidate and reach out to them.
